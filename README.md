# app-updater
app-updater is a swift iOS library. It checks the latest available version of your app on the App Store and notifies the user to update the app.

## Why should I use it?
Just imagine adding <b>ONE LINE OF CODE</b> to keep all your users up to date of your latest updates. This accelerates the adoption of your latest version as soon as it's released. Isn't that great? ;)

## Features

- Simple.
- Fast.
- Redirect user to the App Store.
- Force the update or just display a reminder.
- Localizable, and new languages can be added.

## Show Update Reminder

````swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    AppUpdater.showUpdateMessage()
    return true
}
````

## Force User To Update

````swift
func applicationDidBecomeActive(application: UIApplication) {
    AppUpdater.forceUpdate()
}
````

*Note: This method should be called from `applicationDidBecomeActive(application:)` to show the update message every time the user tries to re-open the app.

## Installation

## Localization
