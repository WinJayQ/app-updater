# app-updater
Swift iOS library checks the latest available version of your app on the AppStore, and shows the user alert to update the app.

## Why should I use it?
Just imagine adding writing <b>ONE LINE OF CODE</b> to let all your users keep track of your latest updates, and getting a huge number of updates once you released your app's update. Isn't great? ;)

## Features

- Simple.
- Fast.
- Redirecting user to the AppStore.
- Ability to force the user to update, or nicly remind him.
- Localizable, and you can add new languages.

## Show Update Reminder

````swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    AppUpdater.showUpdateMessage()
    return true
}
````

````swift
func applicationDidBecomeActive(application: UIApplication) {

}
